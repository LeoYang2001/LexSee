# LexSee - Language Learning App

LexSee is an innovative language learning app designed to help users, particularly those learning a new language, focus on building their language structure without the need for constant translation into their native language. Our goal is to encourage learners to think and speak in their target language naturally while helping them understand the language and its cultural context.

## About

LexSee was developed by **Leo**, **Tabito**, and designed by **Jacinda**, with Leo serving as the team leader.

The idea came from seeing the challenges faced by international students at our college. Many struggle with learning a new language and use ineffective methods to memorize words or immerse themselves in the language and culture. We realized there was a gap in how language learning apps support true language immersion, and that's where LexSee comes in.

LexSee aims to bridge this gap by providing **definitions without translations**, supplemented with **relevant images** to enhance comprehension. Weâ€™ve also incorporated an **AI-driven conversation feature** that simulates real-life scenarios and an **AI-generated story feature** that builds contextual narratives based on words users have learned. Although LexSee is designed for multiple languages, we hope to continue expanding the app's capabilities.

## Features

- **Language word definitions** without translations to the user's native language.
- **Image-based learning**: Relevant visuals for each word to enhance comprehension.
- **AI-driven conversations**: Simulates dialogues to demonstrate how newly learned words can be applied.
- **AI-generated stories**: Contextual narratives using learned words to help users remember them better.
- **Searchable database** of words with their meanings and contextual usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Open Model: GPT-4o-mini**: Used for simulating real-life conversations and generating context-based stories to reinforce learning.
- **Firebase**: Used as the backend for user authentication, data storage, and real-time services.
- **Expo and React Native**: Used for building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **api.dictionaryapi.dev**: Provides word definitions for the app's word search feature.
- **Google Custom Search**: Supports the integration of Google Images to provide relevant visuals for each word.

## Installation

To run LexSee locally, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LexSee.git

## Usage

Once the app is up and running, users can:

1. **Search for a word**: Enter any word to view its definition, accompanied by relevant images. This feature helps users better understand the word in context without relying on translations.
2. **Engage in AI-powered conversations**: Practice applying new words in realistic conversation scenarios. The AI uses the **GPT-4o-mini** model to simulate real-life dialogues, demonstrating how the words can be used in daily life.
3. **Read AI-generated stories**: Select words you've learned, and the AI will generate a short story using those words in context to aid memorization.
4. **Track progress**: Learn and test new words consistently as part of a structured learning path. Users can monitor their learning journey and track which words they've mastered.
