# LexSee - English Learning App

LexSee is an innovative English learning app designed to help users, particularly those learning English as a second language, focus on building their English language structure without the need for constant translation into their native language. Our goal is to encourage learners to think and speak in English naturally while helping them understand the language and its cultural context.

## About

LexSee was developed by **Leo** and **Tabito**, two passionate Computer Science students currently studying in college. We share a common goal: to innovate in ways that make people's lives easier and more meaningful.

The idea came from seeing the challenges faced by international students at our college. Many struggle with learning English and use ineffective methods to memorize words or immerse themselves in the language and culture. We realized there was a gap in how language learning apps support true language immersion, and that's where LexSee comes in.

LexSee aims to bridge this gap by providing **English definitions** without translations, supplemented with **relevant images** to enhance comprehension. Weâ€™ve also incorporated an **AI-driven conversation feature** that simulates real-life scenarios to demonstrate how new words can be used in everyday life. Although LexSee is focused on English learners, we hope to expand the app in the future to support learners of other languages like Spanish, French, Japanese, and more.
